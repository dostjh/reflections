*** When would you want to use a remote respository rather than keeping all your work local?

The benefit of a remote respository is it creates a back up of your work and allows others to more easily collaborate with you and vice versa.

*** Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may end up accepting changes that don't work with what you've written. Manual merges allow you to assess the merging of the content when you're ready to make the next commit of meaningful work.

*** Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks allow the user to modify another user's code base without actually editing their repository. It also gives them credit because the fork knows where it was forked from and broadcasts that.

Clones allow the user to modify another user's code base without actually editing their repository. However, git has no knowledge of where it came from, so you aren't giving the originator credit nor are you able to easily integrate their future changes into your repository.

Branches are copies of a code base within a repository. In this case, you are directly editing the respository, rather than a copy of it.

*** What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can work offline as if working with the remote. However, when you are back online, you will need to make sure you resolve any conflicts that happened in the meantime.
