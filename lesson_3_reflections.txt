*** When would you want to use a remote respository rather than keeping all your work local?

The benefit of a remote respository is it creates a back up of your work and allows others to more easily collaborate with you and vice versa.

*** Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may end up accepting changes that don't work with what you've written. Manual merges allow you to assess the merging of the content when you're ready to make the next commit of meaningful work.
